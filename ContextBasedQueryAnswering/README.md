# Context-based Query Answering over the IOT

This repository includes resources on a research project aimed at developing a context-based approach to query devices in a IOT network. 

## Approach
The approach is based on novel model for devices' contexts whose main feature is the representation of context components at different levels of granularity. The model allows to cope with imprecision and uncertainty in a natural way. It also enables the definition of a context-based query algorithm (CBQA) for searching the IoT, according to given preferences and contexts which can be tightened or relaxed depending on the precision required for the given application goal.
